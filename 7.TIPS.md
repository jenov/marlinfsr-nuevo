## 7.1. **Marlin vs Klipper**

Klipper and Marlin are being compared more and more:

Klipper is often cited for its printing speed with good quality, but its implementation is difficult for a beginner. 
Moreover, you need a RaspBerry to use it,
- you lose control of your main screen,
- it requires a good knowledge of macro-command programming,
- to have a good base on networks.
- the link between your board and the raspberry is always limited to USB and these connection problems.
There is no "plug and play" configuration because everyone has configured his printer by hand.

So to be reserved for **advanced users**.

As for Marlin, it is "Plug and Play". Of course you will go slower (<120mm/s) but the quality will **only depend** on your slicer settings. 

## 7.2. **Delta printer**

Calibration:
FYI: The iterations correspond to the precision and stability of the measurements. The more iterations you have, the more it shows that your machine is a bit too flexible. The progression of iterations stops when the set of different measurements in the sequence (iteration) does not decrease anymore. This is called the standard deviation (std dev.)
For the calibration of the dimensions, it is necessary to do it after a good calibration and not to move the machine, tighten its belts or redo a calibration because it will cancel all your adjustments.
