# Introduction

**You now have the option of integrating profiles for the two main Delta printers: the QQS and the Q5.** 

To do this you need to download the pack **"Date-PS_FLSun_profiles.zip"** then you just have to unzip it in the "resources/profiles" directory of your PrusaSlicer installation folder. 

Once done, launch prusa-slicer.exe and the user interface appears, you can launch the wizard to add the profiles of the printer of your choice.

**Note:** This pack will be integrated in the new version of PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 and above.
